# Backpropagation_Example
Backpropagation is a fundamental component of deep learning for neural networks.
The backpropagation procedure entails calculating the error between the predicted output and the actual target output while passing on information in reverse through the feedforward network, starting from the last layer and moving towards the first. To compute the gradient at a specific layer, the gradients of all subsequent layers are combined using the chain rule of calculus.
